# ENGR132---Final-Project
Large Enzyme Dataset Analysis

Over the Spring 2021 semester, my team and I worked together to devlop a program that could determine the effencies of enzymes given their kinematic data.

I designed and developed an algorithm that could parse large enzyme datasets, and determine certain paramters (Michaelis constant, the inital velocity of the enzyme catalysed reaction, and the final reaction velocity) to evaluate the effeciency of each given enzyme.
